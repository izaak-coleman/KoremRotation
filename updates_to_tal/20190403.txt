Plan:
1. Test for enrichment of copy number lethal genes around Ter. 

   Checking out PanDaTox, the database has eight E. coli strains, each with ~100
   genes registered as unclonable when transformed back into E. coli.
   I need to read the PanDaTox paper to determine how they conclude a gene
   is unclonable. But so far, I think the best approach will be: 
   - From the growth dynamics paper, acquire the list of E. coli genomes
     (representative genomes) used to align the 583 metagenomic datasets and
     compute the E.coli PTRs. 
   - Blast the unclonable genes from the eight strains on PanDaTox against the
     representative genomes to get the position of the unclonable genes in 
     the representative genomes. 
   - Determine location of Ori in the representative genomes. 
   - Compute the location offsets.
   - Perform enrichment analysis. 

2. Read structural variation paper. 

   - Just to be sure, you mean the following https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1065-y.pdf? 

3. Pre-process E. coli metagenomics data into HMM emission string. 

   - Acquire this data from yourself. 
   - Convert all reads aligned to E. coli in each sample to binarised string of
     HMM emission states at each nucleotide (Read starts, read does not start).
